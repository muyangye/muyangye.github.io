This is the cyber existence of Muyang Ye (Âè∂Ê≤êÈò≥), I graduated from the University of Southern California (USC) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure Networkingüåê. During my undergrad, I am extremely fortunate to work with Ph.D. mentor [Rajrup Ghosh](https://nsl.usc.edu/people/rajrup-ghosh/) and professor [Ramesh Govindan](https://govindan.usc.edu/) on volumetric video streaming and rendering. I also had the truly cherished opportunity to collaborate with professor [David Kempe](https://www.david-kempe.com/) on interactive maxflow algorithms visualization. Since I am already listing a bunch of names, I would like to also express my sincere gratitude to (and wholeheartedly recommend) professor [Aaron Cote](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~aaroncot/), my Data Structures course instructor, and the best instructor of my entire educational journey.

I originally decided to study Computer Science because I wanted to modify/make games (yeah, a classical lame reason lol). However, after several years of programming, I've shifted my focus to the practicality of Computer Science to solve problems in daily lives. For example, I have built a fast [travel planner/Traveling Salesman solver](https://github.com/muyangye/Traveling_Salesman_Solver_Google_Maps) (although I don't really have enough money to justify the demand of planning the shortest travel route for 20+ places yetüòÜ) and a [Netease playlist to Spotify migrater](https://github.com/muyangye/Netease_To_Spotify). In addition to building tools myself, I enjoy building tools that have a much broader influence with other open source enthusiasts. To this end, I contributed to [Apache Streampipes](https://github.com/apache/streampipes) and was nominated as a **committer**. I greatly appreciate all the awesome open-source projects I've used and the nice, friendly open-source community. Coming from computing olympiad background in high school, I also love to explore theoretical aspects of Computer Science such as algorithms.

In my leisure time, I really love to play video games. I used to play games quite competitively (mainly League of Legends, its Chinese mobile version, and Hearthstone, I am pretty bad at 3D FPS): ranked top 1000 end of season out of more than 300,000,000 players, escaped classes to go to [PC bangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_bang) when I was 11 (they provided fake IDs that are over 18 lol), and earned some cash by boosting or companionship. I really enjoy the 120% focus, physical excitement/exhaustment, and teamwork in top-ranked matches. Below are some photos of me winning/participating large scale esports competitions:

However, I decided to stop playing so much because of two reasons. For one, I realized I probably need to get some good education. Second, there exists way too many "actors" who intentionally lose for up to $1000 each match paid by "bosses" on the opponent side. This, combined with the foolish policy of banning professional players under 18, foreshadowed China's failure in esports in my opinion. That being said, nowadays I still play quite a lot of single-player games. My top 3 are Mass Effect Series, Legend of Zelda TOTK/BOTW, Life Is Strange I, followed closely by various games (more like DLCs, lol) by CDPR. I guess I am just a huge Tolkien fantasy nerd!

Other than video games, I enjoy badminton (also to some competitive degree but much less than video games), traveling, mountaineering, cooking (maybe I'll create a page in the future), skateboarding, archery, billiard, normal/stand-up comedies (favorite: George Carlinüë®‚Äçü¶≥), and all kinds of card games. <del>In addition, living in Los Angeles, I love to explore the most authentic food from all over the world.</del> (Only after leaving LA did I learn how superior LA's Asian restaurants are compared to other cities in the US, which kinda pushed my cooking skills to the next level)
