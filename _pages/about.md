This is the cyber existence of Muyang Ye (Âè∂Ê≤êÈò≥), I graduated from the University of Southern California (USC) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure Networkingüåê. During my undergrad, I am extremely fortunate to work with Ph.D. mentor [Rajrup Ghosh](https://nsl.usc.edu/people/rajrup-ghosh/), professor [Ramesh Govindan](https://govindan.usc.edu/) on volumetric video streaming and rendering and with professor [David Kempe](https://www.david-kempe.com/) on interactive maxflow algorithms visualization.

I originally decided to study Computer Science because I wanted to modify/make games (some people think programmers should not expose this classical lame reason lol). However, after several years of programming, I've shifted my focus to the practicality of Computer Science to solve problems in daily lives. For example, I have built a fast [travel planner/Traveling Salesman solver](https://github.com/muyangye/Traveling_Salesman_Solver_Google_Maps) (although I don't really have enough money to justify the demand of planning the shortest travel route for 20+ places yetüòÜ) and a [Netease playlist to Spotify migrater](https://github.com/muyangye/Netease_To_Spotify). In addition to building tools myself, I enjoy building tools that have a much broader influence with other open source enthusiasts. To this end, I contributed to [Apache Streampipes](https://github.com/apache/streampipes) and was nominated as a **committer**. I greatly appreciate all the awesome open-source projects I've used and the nice, friendly open-source community. Coming from competitive programming background in high school, I also love to explore theoretical aspects of Computer Science such as algorithms.

In my leisure time, I enjoy [video games](https://muyangye.github.io/games/) (current: Legend of Zelda TOTK), traveling, mountaineering, cooking (maybe I'll create a page in the future), badminton, skateboarding, archery, billiard, normal/stand-up comedies (favorite: George Carlinüë®‚Äçü¶≥), and all kinds of card games. <del>In addition, living in Los Angeles, I love to explore the most authentic Asian restaurants in North America around San Gabriel Valley - Rowland Heights.</del> (Only after leaving LA did I learn how superior LA's Asian food is compared to other places)
