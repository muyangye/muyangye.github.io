This is the cyber existence of Muyang Ye (pronounced as Moo-yahng Yeh), I graduated from the University of Southern California (USC) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure Networkingüåê. During my undergrad, I am extremely fortunate to work with Ph.D. mentor [Rajrup Ghosh](https://nsl.usc.edu/people/rajrup-ghosh/) and professor [Ramesh Govindan](https://govindan.usc.edu/) on volumetric video streaming and rendering. I also had the truly cherished opportunity to collaborate with professor [David Kempe](https://www.david-kempe.com/) on interactive maxflow algorithms visualization. Since I have already listed a bunch of names, I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to and wholeheartedly recommend professor [Aaron Cote](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~aaroncot/), the instructor of my Data Structures course, and the best instructor of my entire educational journey.

I originally decided to study Computer Science because I wanted to modify/make games (yeah, a classical lame reason). However, after several years of programming, I've learned its power to make my life easier. I readily build gadgets that solve problems in daily lives, such as a [playlist migrator from Netease Cloud Music to Spotify](https://github.com/muyangye/Netease_To_Spotify) and a fast [travel planner/Traveling Salesman Problem approximation solver](https://github.com/muyangye/Traveling_Salesman_Solver_Google_Maps), even though I probably don't have enough money/time to justify needing to plan the shortest travel route for 20+ places yetüòÜ.

Most recently, I have built more large-scale and rigorous softwares. For example, I contributed to [Apache Streampipes](https://github.com/apache/streampipes) and was nominated as a **committer**. I also developed and published [iFlow](https://github.com/Maxflow-Visualization/iFlow), an interactive max-flow min-cut algorithms visualizer to help students understand this difficult subject. These projects have been especially enjoyable to work on, not only because they allow me to gain experiene writing industry/academia grade code before actually going to industry/academia, but also due to their publicly beneficial nature (well, I hope they were helpful to at least one user xD). Coming from computing olympiad background in high school, I love to explore theoretical aspects of Computer Science as well such as algorithms.

<!-- In my leisure time, I love to play video games. In fact, I used to play quite competitively (mainly League of Legends, its mobile version, and Hearthstone, I am pretty bad at FPS): ranked top 1000 end of season out of more than 300,000,000 players, escaped classes to go to [PC bangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_bang) when I was 11 (they provided fake IDs :P), and earned some cash by boosting or companionship. I really enjoy the 120% focus, physical excitement/exhaustment, and teamwork in top-ranked matches. Below are some photos of me winning/participating at major esports competitions:

</p>

However, I decided to stop playing so much for two reasons. First, I realized I probably need to get some good education, and keeping competitive at those games really does take a lot of time as I need to keep up with new patches. Second, there exists way too many "actors" who'd intentionally lose for up to $1000 compensation each game that makes solo queue basically unplayable. That being said, nowadays I still play a bit of single-player games. My top 3 are Mass Effect Series, Legend of Zelda TOTK/BOTW, Life Is Strange I, followed closely by various games (more like DLCs, lol) by CDPR. I guess I am just a huge Tolkien style fantasy nerd! -->

In my leisure time, I love to play video games. In fact, I used to play quite competitively and earned some cash by boosting or winning esports competitions. I also enjoy badminton (once competitively too but much less so compared to video games), [traveling](https://muyangye.github.io/places/), mountaineering, cooking (maybe I'll create a page in the future), skateboarding, archery, normal/stand-up comedies (fav: George Carlinüë®‚Äçü¶≥), and all kinds of card games. <del>In addition, living in Los Angeles, I love to explore the most authentic food from all over the world.</del> (Only after leaving LA did I learn how superior LA's Asian restaurants are compared to other cities in the US, which kinda pushed my cooking skills to the next level)
