This is the cyber existence of Muyang Ye (Âè∂Ê≤êÈò≥), I graduated from the University of Southern California (USC) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure Networkingüåê. During my undergrad, I am extremely fortunate to work with Ph.D. mentor [Rajrup Ghosh](https://nsl.usc.edu/people/rajrup-ghosh/) and professor [Ramesh Govindan](https://govindan.usc.edu/) on volumetric video streaming and rendering. I also had the truly cherished opportunity to collaborate with professor [David Kempe](https://www.david-kempe.com/) on interactive maxflow algorithms visualization. Since I am already listing a bunch of names, I would like to also express my sincere gratitude to (and wholeheartedly recommend) professor [Aaron Cote](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~aaroncot/), my Data Structures course instructor, and the best instructor of my entire educational journey.

I originally decided to study Computer Science because I wanted to modify/make games (yeah, a classical lame reason lol). However, after several years of programming, I've shifted my focus to the practicality of Computer Science to solve problems in daily lives. For example, I have built a fast [travel planner/Traveling Salesman solver](https://github.com/muyangye/Traveling_Salesman_Solver_Google_Maps) (although I don't really have enough money to justify the demand of planning the shortest travel route for 20+ places yetüòÜ) and a [Netease playlist to Spotify migrater](https://github.com/muyangye/Netease_To_Spotify). In addition to building tools myself, I enjoy building tools that have a much broader influence with other open source enthusiasts. To this end, I contributed to [Apache Streampipes](https://github.com/apache/streampipes) and was nominated as a **committer**. I greatly appreciate all the awesome open-source projects I've used and the nice, friendly open-source community. Coming from competitive programming background in high school, I also love to explore theoretical aspects of Computer Science such as algorithms.

In my leisure time, I enjoy [video games](https://muyangye.github.io/games/), traveling, mountaineering, cooking (maybe I'll create a page in the future), badminton, skateboarding, archery, billiard, normal/stand-up comedies (favorite: George Carlinüë®‚Äçü¶≥), and all kinds of card games. <del>In addition, living in Los Angeles, I love to explore the most authentic Asian restaurants in USA around San Gabriel Valley - Rowland Heights.</del> (Only after leaving LA did I learn how superior LA's Asian food is compared to other places, which kinda pushed my cooking skills to the next level)
