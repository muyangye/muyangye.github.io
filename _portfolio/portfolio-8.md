Catch That Puppo is the final project of my Game Design minor's Workshop class (there's another intermediate one which I haven't taken yet). We have both an in-person set of cards + map + rules and an online set of cards + map + rules. The online one is a Steam workshop item that is importable to a game in Steam called Tabletop Simulator. [This](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2656892048) is the link of the workshop item and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ThIk0xR7emt9Z89I7ZF8A1WsRZ02akKh/view?usp=sharing) is the rule of Catch That Puppo! I really did minimal programming in the project since the class was about designing 5 tabletop games, but I have implemented a Lua script that automatically deals cards based on the number of players. After you successfully load our game in Tabletop Simulator, it should look like the following figure, press "Start!" to deal cards and start!
