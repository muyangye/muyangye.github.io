VEX is a Robotics competition that I participated in high school. The season was Turning Point. Our team won the:
<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
  <li><strong>World Championship Qualification</strong>, 400 out of 20k+ teams worldwide, 1 of the 19 teams representing China</li>
  <li><strong>First Prize & Design Award</strong>, Asia Open</li>
  <li><strong>Judges Award</strong>, China National</li>
</ul>

This is our robot:

It has a ball suction mechanism, a shooting mechanism, a plate flipping mechanism, and 4 V5 motors on wheels. I didn't build the robot but was the programmer and driver. Unfortunately I can't open source the code since it contains strategies that underclassmen in my high school are still using (the next class won the World Champion lol). This is a featured match of our team in the World Championship (our robot is the initially front one of the red alliance, the first 15 seconds are automatic phase and the remaining time are manual control phase. Also my teammates were speaking in Chinese in the video lol):
