Have you wondered how cameras turn an object in 3D space to a 2D image? This post covers the entire process and goes very
deep into half of that process. I am writing this post because this is such a simple subject and yet there has not been
any post that clearly explains it (mainly due to too-many terminologies, and most posts just analyze math without even
telling the basic concepts). I personally struggled a lot on this during my research experience, so I hope whoever sees
this post will help future .

## Space
Space is probably the most basic and important concept to understand, unfortunately as far as I know, no tutorial on cameras
ever covered space. I don't have a precise definition of space but you can essentially understand space in this way:
**In object X's space, X itself is at (0, 0, 0). No matter X's rotation, The lines that cross X's centroid orthogonally
from "left-right", "high-low", "forward-backward" are x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, respectively**. This definition means that
coordinate axes **in different objects' spaces might be different**. The meaning/significance/essence of an object's space
is that it captures the **relative transform of other objects**. To better illustrate this, consider the following picture:

[Space](/images/blog_post_1/space.png)

In this picture, the coordinates of Cube O, Cube A, and Cube B are *(0, 0, 0)*, *(3, 2, 0)*, and *(-4, 0, 5)* in **world space**
(or, Cube O's space since it's at origin). They mean that starting from origin or Cube O, we should go 3 units in x-axis,
2 units in y-axis to reach Cube A, and we should go -4 units in x-axis, 5 units in z-axis to reach Cube B. Now, if we take
everything in Cube A's space, **Cube A itself is at *(0, 0, 0)***, and Cube O is located at *(-3, -2, 0)* because we need to
go -3 units in x-axis, -2 units in y-axis to reach Cube O. Similarly, the coordinate of Cube B in Cube A's space is
*(-7, -2, 5)*.

Extremely simple concept isn't it? just to reiterate, an object's space captures the **relative transform of other objects**.

## "Space Transformation Matrix"
In the above content, we learned what is space and saw an example of turning the coordinate in one space to the coordinate
in another space. However, the reason why we can easily derive the coordinate/space transition is because all cubes are
not rotated. If we take into account of rotation and scale, we need a more systematic way of doing space transition:
**"space transformation matrix"** (quoted because I invented this term). Let's call this matrix **M**, **M** takes an
input of one object space's coordinates and outputs the same position in another object space's coordinates like this:

Specifically, the first 3x3 entries applies the transformation of scale and rotation, and the last column applies the
translational (translation is the terminology for position) transformation. For more detailed breakdown and how to extract standalone scale, rotation, translation matrices,
please give [this post](https://www.brainvoyager.com/bv/doc/UsersGuide/CoordsAndTransforms/SpatialTransformationMatrices.html)
a look which is very well written.

How do we calculate **M**? The answer is dependent on the two spaces we are transforming from and to. We just need to
define the required scale (**S**), rotational(**R**), and translational(**T**) changes/matrices of from -> to and then
**M = S * R * T** (or **T * R * S** depending on the current convention). However, here
is a very common **M** we should know and I will use it to demonstrate the magic of transformation matrix, which is the
transformation matrix from an arbitrary object's space to world space. **Given the object's scale s, rotation r (a quaternion),
and translation t in *world space*, M is:**

This looks intimidating, but since I am only demonstrating the cubes and they are not rotated or scaled, the entire upper-left 3x3
sub-matrix is just an identity matrix. For example, let's say I want to calculate Cube B's world coordinate, **given Cube
B's coordinate in Cube A's space and the transformation matrix M** (plugging in Cube A's scale, rotation, and translation in
world space to the intimidating formula above) **from Cube A's space to world space**, the result is:

![Result](/images/blog_post_1/result.png)

Where *(-4, 0, 5)* is indeed Cube B's coordinate in world space! We have now seen how "space transformation matrix" can
help us transform the coordinates in one space to another space. If rotation and scale are added, this method still works.
The resulting coordinate is likely going to contain decimals which are hard to plot in the Space section.
